# PyLink

A 2d game framework using Python's pygame modules.

This project was inspired by recent tutorials I've been following, including:
  - Clear Code's Zelda in Python tutorial video on YouTube 
  - Parralel Realities' SDL2 tutorial series available on the dev's website (source code available on itch.io)

The goal of this project is to produce a library or framework which can be used for the rapid development 
of increasingly more complex 2d games.

This project's current focus is the development of a 2d "reverse bullet hell" game using assets
created by RGS_Dev on itch.io.
